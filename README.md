# curlzillabox

> Curlzillabox has that same great curlzilla flavor, in a tiny container you can abuse anywhere. Kind of like what Java was supposed to be like, but with less debugging. - Curlzilla

**SPIN-UP**

1. Put the git repo where you intend to run it.
2. Build the container: docker build -t curzillabox
3. Run the container: docker run -ti curlzillabox curlzilla https://$YOURTARGETHERE $DELAY $ITERATIONS
4. PROFIT. If you're not profiting at the end, you're doing it wrong.
